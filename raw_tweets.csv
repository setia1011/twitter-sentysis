I don‚Äôt know your conditions but an individual with one adverse condition is around 2,000 times more likely to die if they get Covid than they are to be struck by lightning.  People really need a better understanding of risk."

2022-02-13 00:37:07,means_over,"@JReinerMD Does it have anything to do with the healthcare system being better and the fact that their people aren‚Äôt fat, unhealthy diabetics?   Even if they masked up, the people that think it‚Äôs fat and okay will be getting pulled into the hospital. Obesity was the worst thing for covid."

2022-02-13 00:37:06,vickersty,"@drmikehart Yes. Vitamin D is...a vitamin. It's essential for health. This isn't controversial.  It doesn't prevent covid, per se, but *not having enough* is very bad for you.  It's also a very safe preventative health measure in general, and everyone should take it into consideration."
